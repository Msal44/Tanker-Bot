# Tanker-Bot
Robotics Club Project.
In the beginning of this prjects we were told to learn on our own by using the arduino website https://www.arduino.cc/ as well as understand the hardware that was being used. I also worked with Electrical Engineers and Mechanical Engineers to buiold the bot, but I will only be focusing on the code for the tanker bot.
